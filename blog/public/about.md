Hi. My name is Chris Pauley and I am a software engineer. I didn't finish college, I found building things to be more fun. I've worked with startups, lifestyle companies, non-profits and development firms. What I learned during all of that is that it pays more to work on building a better society than building a bigger bank account.

It is my goal with this blog to both keep technical notes and personal ones. I hope to document a journey of finding a way to be a software-obsessed techie that is solely focused on building a happier, more compassionate society. It might get a little political. I may be wrong from time to time. Say hi, call me out on my bullshit, or send me a picture of a cat: [chris@v3x.pw](mailto:chris@v3x.pw)
