		<p>For this application a large portion of the state is what would be stored as a project file on local machines. In this application, that file can be stored in a database as JSON, which can be quickly parsed when it is retrieved from the server. During runtime, this state must be watched to update the DOM when necessary. As this project may become quite large and complex, it requires functionality for observing specific elements for changes.</p>

<p>The Store class provides a centralized place for this state to be held and provides functionality for it to be observed. </p>

        Taking Advantage of Modern CPU Advancements

		<p>This is a part of a series of posts that follow the development of a side project I&#39;ve been working on called HelloAudio, an in-browser multitrack audio editor. The project is primarily for exploring thoughts I&#39;ve had on technical implementations. As these pieces come to fruition I am writing about them here.</p>

<h2>Taking Advantage of Modern CPU Advancements</h2>

<p>Over the past several years processor clock speeds have not improved much. The Pentium 4 in 2004 had a base clock speed of 2.4Ghz compared to the Ryzen 2700X at 3.7GHz or the i9 at 3.6GHz both released in 2018, 14 years later. That&#39;s only 150% improvement over nearly a decade and a half. Obviously the important thing to note here is core count. With 8 cores now being standard that rate of improvement is still substantial. However, scaling with cores does not come as easily as scaling with processor speed.</p>

<p>The following are charts of the base clock, memory bandwidth, and core count of Intel processors of the past several years. As described above, the base clock and bandwidth have hardly moved, but there have been significant improvements in core counts.</p>

        Load Balancing for helloAudio

		<p>This is a part of a series of posts that follow the development of a side project I&#39;ve been working on called HelloAudio, an in-browser multitrack audio editor. The project is primarily for exploring thoughts I&#39;ve had on technical implementations. As these pieces come to fruition I am writing about them here.</p>

<h2>Load Balancing on the API Server</h2>

<p>The API server for HelloAudio has a somewhat unique workload. It will be filled with both simple short-lived connections for reading and writing to the database, longer connections for transferring files, and compute-heavy connections for audio processing. The majority of the connections will be in the first two categories.</p>

<p>The architecture of the API is quite versatile, but does focus on shorter connections that will need to communicate with database and storage servers. The API has a thread pool and each thread has a worker pool which asynchronously work through requests in the threads queue. This creates a choke-point in which a particularly heavy compute request could be processed by a worker while there are a number of smaller connections in the queue. There is no way to know whether a connection will be long or short until that connection has been accepted and read by a worker. </p>

<p>However, when accepting a connection we can check on each thread and determine which is most likely to handle the connection the fastest. In order to do this, we need some way to predict the amount of time it takes a thread to completely burn through its queue.</p>

        Firefox Focus for Android is not necessarily secure
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">09 Mar 2018</span>
	
		<p>Firefox Focus is Mozilla&#39;s attempt at a privacy-first mobile browser. By all accounts, it&#39;s a great attempt at solving the browser privacy issue on mobile devices. Many complain about the lack of features, but for those focused on maintaining privacy, having less features can many times come as a relief.</p>

<p>I noticed the other day that after running the browser, clearing everything, and opening up a new session I still had links marked as visited. As the main claim of the browser is that it automatically erases your browser history, this is a bit concerning. <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/322">I am not the first</a> to find this issue, and there is a fix on the way. The whole situation is still a bit concerning.</p>

<p>Many years ago <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2010/03/31/plugging-the-css-history-leak/">Mozilla posted</a> about changes they had made to make sure that an attacker would not be able to generate a list of websites a user had visited by checking the style of visited links. The changes were effective and thorough, but even by their own admission, <a href="https://dbaron.org/mozilla/visited-privacy#limits">would not be all-encompassing</a>. Firefox Focus would truly mitigate all attacks of this kind if the claims of removing browser history were as true as one might hope (or more worryingly, one might assume).</p>

		<p>Google finally released <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/headless-chrome">Chrome Headless</a> and shortly after, a nodejs library called <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/">Puppeteer</a>. They have a decent document laying out how to use the API but a number of pieces are non-obvious. I needed to do a few things like connect to an existing chrome instance, use an http proxy, </p>
