  <h1 class="post-title">Dogma -- One of The Pitfalls of Engineering Leadership</h1>
  <span class="post-date">18 May 2019</span>
  <p>In the tech industry our leaders are held in high regard and the successful ones have their stories told and are imitated by many. Due to their success, the style of leadership is not necessarily questioned; a dangerous pattern.</p>

<p>In this post I&#39;ll discuss one of the recently popular such styles of leadership: Dogmatic Leadership.</p>

<h2>Dogma</h2>

<p>The idea of dogma is to have a core set of values which are absolute. They are static and infallible, transcendent of time and context. Popularized by religion, these beliefs were handed down from a higher authority. In business however, these are the values and vision of the company.</p>

<p>In dogmatically-lead businesses this means that the vision of the company is itself dogma. Absolute, static, and infallible. The vision of such a company must be long in scope, many times unachievable in scale. A broad statement about the way the world should be, but is not currently.</p>

<h2>Enforcing Dogma</h2>

<p>The role of leadership as it pertains to company direction is to inform and inspire the actions of the company to align with the mission and vision. This may also mean discouraging, de-emphasizing, or even vetoing actions which run contrary to those values.</p>

<p>With a dogmatic approach, this is a very easy task. The only question to be answered is does an action align with the vision? </p>

<p>However, when the first pieces are set and have passed the test of dogma, they themselves become an extension of that dogma. To question a piece that is aligned with the dogma becomes a question of the dogma itself. As the dogma is infallible, it is not to be questioned.</p>

<p>As each step is taken by the company, the past cannot easily be questioned, mistakes cannot easily be admitted, and failure is left unlearned from.</p>

<p>All the while, individuals within the company may see the missteps in the past and a path to protect the future. The adamant dogmatist will be forced to reject these proposals and even question the individual as they are opposing the dogma.</p>

<p>This is what has been seen in such companies as Theranos. Engineers knew the problems with the Edison (Theranos&#39; flagship product) and that the problems being approached were not feasible, possibly even impossible. The leaders were dogmatic in their beliefs not only in the vision of the company, but the definition of the product. The Edison was a static, absolute truth and anyone questioning the path to achieving it was questioning the company itself. In the end, the only people remaining to speak to the leaders were &quot;yes people&quot;.</p>

<h2>A Better Approach</h2>

<p>Having strongly held values is not in and of itself a bad thing. They hold fast the company direction as the market and environment sway. However, rationalism shows us that every understanding is only a perception and based on new information that perception may change.</p>

<p>Should the values, vision, mission, or culture of the company be thought to be absolute and infallible they should still be subject to question. If they are indeed infallible, no amount of questioning will dissolve them. If they are not, questions provide an opportunity for better understanding and welcome change.</p>

<p>There are some who may say there are cultural values that should be held dogmatic. Such values as equality, seeking out diverse perspectives, or transparency certainly are thought to transcend context and thus be unquestionable. However, given the opportunity to question these values (when properly held), the questioner is provided an opportunity to learn from why these values are held and strengthen the belief in these values as a team member.</p>

<p>In conclusion, hold values closely and let them be questioned. Good values grow stronger from questioning and detrimental values are dissolved.</p>
