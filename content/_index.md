I'm Cass and this is my engineering blog. I'm also super interested in philosophy, incentives and power structures, and linguistics, so those tend to be the lenses through which I write about software.

Fair warning, I'm not really trying to _do blogging_ so there's not likely to be consistency from post to post, timeline, or assumed audience here.
